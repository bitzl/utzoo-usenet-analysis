Re: Raster vs. Vector
In reply to ...minn-ua!kirk I would take issue with points 1 and 3.
1) No three-color, full spectrum, commercial color vector display exists.

A couple of years ago at NCC '78 I can remember seeing an Evans&Sutherland
demo showing an excellent, RGB vector display. I understand that the
technique employed three guns and phosphor triads. The convergence
problems must have been tremendous, but in the carnival atmosphere of an
NCC it looked damned good.

3) A good raster tube, at a resolution of 1Kx1K, can display lines that
   are indistinguishable from a true vector for all intents and purposes.

Typical pixel-equivalent resolutions for vector displays are 4Kx4K and
produce noticably smoother random lines than any 1Kx1K raster system,
and given that the lines are actually "drawn" by the electron gun, any
stair-step effect is purely the effect of the shadow mask/phosphor
combination.
